# Data-Cleaning-Exercise-Kaggle

Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

Data cleaning is a key part of data science, but it can be deeply frustrating. Why are some of your text fields garbled? What should you do about those missing values? Why aren’t your dates formatted correctly? How can you quickly clean up inconsistent data entry? 

In this, you’ll learn how to tackle some of the most common data cleaning problems so you can get to actually analyzing your data faster.

<b>Benefits of Data Cleaning</b>

Here are several key benefits that come out of the data cleaning process:

1. It removes major errors and inconsistencies that are inevitable when multiple sources of data are getting pulled into one dataset.
2. Using tools to cleanup data will make everyone more efficient since they’ll be able to quickly get what they need from the data.
3. Fewer errors means happier customers and fewer frustrated employees.
4. The ability to map the different functions and what your data is intended to do and where it is coming from your data.
